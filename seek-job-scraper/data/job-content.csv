   About Us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the great challenges in the world right now is the need to move to greener energy and technology solutions. To do that the world needs more copper, steel and rare earth metals than ever before. So here’s the challenge: to go green the world needs (much) more mining, but mining already contributes to about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  At MaxMine we work to improve mining efficiency - we focus on what we can do
  <em>
   today
  </em>
  to improve that situation. We’ve demonstrated productivity improvements of 15% on some sites with corresponding reductions in effective greenhouse gas emissions by 5-10% from current operational baselines. Our client base is growing and our analytics services are rapidly expanding.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Government - Federal,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.
