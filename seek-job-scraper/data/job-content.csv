   About Us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the great challenges in the world right now is the need to move to greener energy and technology solutions. To do that the world needs more copper, steel and rare earth metals than ever before. So here’s the challenge: to go green the world needs (much) more mining, but mining already contributes to about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  At MaxMine we work to improve mining efficiency - we focus on what we can do
  <em>
   today
  </em>
  to improve that situation. We’ve demonstrated productivity improvements of 15% on some sites with corresponding reductions in effective greenhouse gas emissions by 5-10% from current operational baselines. Our client base is growing and our analytics services are rapidly expanding.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Government - Federal,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

Seonix believes there is a major opportunity to transform clinical glaucoma care and reduce preventable blindness. Seonix’s technology is based on seminal research into a polygenic risk score for glaucoma, published in Nature Genetics.
 </p>

 <p>
  The successful candidate will report to the CEO and will work with Seonix’s Scientific Advisory team, bioinformaticians and software engineers. The company’s leadership team has a track record of building genetics businesses that change clinical care globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role is ideally full-time, but could also be part-time, with the range of responsibilities to be adjusted to fit available time. A minimum commitment of 3 days per week is required.

  If you are seeking to advance your career in artificial intelligence (AI) and interested in the emerging field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering an exceptional opportunity to apply for an innovative project-based PhD at UniSA in partnership with the Motion Platform and Mixed Reality (MPMR) Lab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This project aims to explore DRL as a key area of AI research to address cutting-edge problems in human-trustworthy decision intelligence. As part of an emerging topic in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the challenge of the DRL training process is that humans struggle to quickly understand the complex environments that DRL machines interact with and to interpret relevant actions to achieve goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this research project, you will develop interpretable systems with human-like reasoning capabilities through interactive machine learning prototypes that enhance human-machine collaboration. Additionally, the project involves researching representation algorithms to extract key properties in DRL machines and exploring human trust in machine interpretations, which are critical to the success of human-trusted DRL in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This PhD is an exciting opportunity to be a part of a growing field at the very edge of development and prepares you for a career in an expert field of high demand.

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>

   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  You'd be joining a world-class team of engineers on a truly one-of-a-kind payment &amp; financial management application. The platform has already been extremely well received by the Australian market. Following a $20 million funding round, the plan now is to (quite literally) take on the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   PhD Project - Parametric VR: Applying and Exploring Virtual Reality Systems to Better Support Parametric Design
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Inform the impact on architects and industry perceptions regarding adopting VR in Parametric Design
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project has been established at the University of South Australia (UniSA) to investigate a new and intuitive set of user interactions for Virtual Reality (VR) to support parametric design in architecture. 'Parametric VR' is a new and exciting research topic that can advance the architecture and construction sector by supporting highly innovative design processes, improved design performances, optimised design interactions, and simplified workflows. These improvements are realised through VR-enabled capabilities: design immersion, virtual prototyping, and cognitive enhancement. As more daily activities are conducted remotely, VR immersive technologies can also effectively support design collaborations. VR can improve interactions in parametric design, which have been critically underdeveloped. Parametric VR will further the developments of both technologies and deepen their impact on the global design industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supported by the Discovery Project team, UniSA Creative is seeking a qualified candidate to conduct a PhD research project to develop and test prototype(s) of Parametric VR, a novel system of VR tools to support parametric design, allowing architects to directly edit parametric design in VR across the project lifecycle. This PhD will specifically focus on design application and adoption of the technological developments including:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Determining appropriate application(s) of VR to the parametric design pipeline and at the true scale of architectural design projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Developing/adopting and mapping software tools and VR interactions against the selected parametric processes and tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Testing the effectiveness of Parametric VR prototype(s) and design scenario(s) through user studies with architects.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The project will be hosted at UniSA Creative and the
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/ive/"" target=""_blank"">
   Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments
  </a>
  (IVE), in collaboration with UniSA STEM. The successful PhD candidate will be supported by the extended research networks including end-user organisations and international collaborators as enabled by the ARC Discovery Project. The successful candidate will be working amongst a strong cohort of PhD students in IVE, who share similar passion and research interests to create high-impact outputs with strong peer support. During the project, the PhD candidate will be guided to develop research publications in journals and conference for knowledge dissemination and exchange. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to undertake a placement at the end user organisation to gain end-user/industry experiences and to further validate and disseminate the research.

  Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  An exciting research opportunity is available for a postdoctoral researcher to support Australian Research Council (ARC)-funded research in the team of Dr Yee Lian Chew, based at the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, Bedford Park, Flinders University (Kaurna Country).
 </p>
 <p>
  This project focuses on identifying how proteostasis mechanisms contribute to neuronal ageing using protein proximity-labelling techniques in cultured cells and in
  <em>
   Caenorhabditis elegans
  </em>
  (nematode roundworm).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Postdoctoral Research Scientist will drive research activities using cultured cells and
  <em>
   C. elegans
  </em>
  models, using a combination of protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy. In this role you will be expected to work under guidance from supervisors (weekly/fortnightly) but will work autonomously on a day-to-day basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is dedicated to both promoting equity and inclusivity and acting in an equitable and inclusive way. We also celebrate and champion diversity. We are keen to support the careers of researchers who have had career disruptions or who currently or will in the future, have caring roles. We encourage women and gender diverse applicants, people with a disability, people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, and those from culturally diverse backgrounds to apply. The work involves tasks requiring manual dexterity, visual acuity adequate to perform microscopy and dispense small volume, and a willingness to work with nematodes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About You
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be an enthusiastic and motivated Postdoctoral Research Scientist with demonstrated organisational skill and the motivation to carry out autonomous research and meet deadlines. You will have well developed interpersonal skills, demonstrating cultural sensitivity and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. You will also show evidence of well-developed written and verbal communication skills, for example, publications or submissions to scientific journals/conference presentations. To be successful in this role you will also demonstrate:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A PhD (or will shortly satisfy the requirements of a PhD) in a relevant discipline such as Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and/or Neuroscience (or any relevant field).
  </li>
  <li>
   An ability to apply skills in protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy across a range of tasks in the completion of research projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with protein biochemistry (western blotting, sample preparation for mass spectrometry) is highly desirable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with tissue culture and/or
   <em>
    elegans
   </em>
   is desirable but not essential.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,6d,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.
