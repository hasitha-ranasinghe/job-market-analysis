STEM Analyst – Impacts of Advanced Technologies APS Level 4/5-6,Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$69,811 - $95,873 (plus Super)",Full time,20/05/2022,https://www.seek.com.au//job/57057656?type=promoted,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Your Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two ongoing positions as a STEM Analyst on the Impacts of Advanced Technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will develop a deep understanding of a range of technologies, and work with experts to foresee how these technologies will develop into the future. You will then creatively assess how these developments might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests, with a focus on Defence and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others). You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a sound understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.

   About Us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the great challenges in the world right now is the need to move to greener energy and technology solutions. To do that the world needs more copper, steel and rare earth metals than ever before. So here’s the challenge: to go green the world needs (much) more mining, but mining already contributes to about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions every year.
 </p>
 <p>
  At MaxMine we work to improve mining efficiency - we focus on what we can do
  <em>

  to improve that situation. We’ve demonstrated productivity improvements of 15% on some sites with corresponding reductions in effective greenhouse gas emissions by 5-10% from current operational baselines. Our client base is growing and our analytics services are rapidly expanding.

STEM Analyst – Impacts of Advanced Technologies APS Level 4/5-6,Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Other,"$69,811 - $95,873 (plus Super)",Full time,20/05/2022,https://www.seek.com.au//job/57057656?type=standout,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">

  <strong>
   Your Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two ongoing positions as a STEM Analyst on the Impacts of Advanced Technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will develop a deep understanding of a range of technologies, and work with experts to foresee how these technologies will develop into the future. You will then creatively assess how these developments might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests, with a focus on Defence and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others). You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a sound understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.

 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments.

 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.

  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group.

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Work for a Microsoft Gold Partner

  <li>
   <strong>
    Use the latest &amp; greatest technology to help clients with their productivity solutions

  <li>
   <strong>
    Become a member of a national team with a global footprint
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Role Overview:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Working in a close-knit, national Client Care team, you will contribute in a collaborative environment, working with many different organisations and liaising across our Client Delivery and Product Development teams, to find the best outcomes for clients. You will be a first contact point for our clients who have exhausted their own internal teams problem-solving abilities, giving them advice and support and helping them through technical application faults. While you will be a natural communicator and have strong written and oral communication abilities, we think you will probably end each day having learned something new. This role offers significant Microsoft application variety where you will participate in the support, administration, configuration, and enhancement of Project Online, Project for the Web, the Power Platform, and Office 365 environments. You will have a broad knowledge in various areas of Microsoft applications, particularly focused on Microsoft cloud technologies, and ideally have experience partnering with external clients, to provide support and uphold their application support expectations. Using your strong communication skills, you will provide the highest level of client service, keep promises and uphold our values, such as “we are easy to work with”.
 </p>
 <p>
  You understand that being part of the team we refer to as “Client Care“ is not about meeting the minimum SLA and hiding behind an email account; you won’t be afraid to tackle a problem head on with a client, pick up the phone, or suggest creative work-around solutions to solve their business problems. You are accountable and see things through to the end, rather than looking for the first opportunity to “handball”. Finally, this role may provide career growth into other areas of the Sensei business, including front-line Consulting, Product Development or other teams as the company continues to grow and add capabilities.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What your day might look like (beware, in this job, there is no typical day):
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Help clients with technical challenges they have in using a range of Sensei’s systems, software and solutions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Give suggestions, advice and guidance on how to best use their solution.
  </li>
  <li>
   Act as the first point of support for premium clients who have exhausted their own internal support teams problem solving abilities.
  </li>
  <li>
   Troubleshoot and problem solve technical Microsoft application faults to identify and diagnose issues logically. This can be either by telephone, email or remote login.
  </li>
  <li>
   Educate our clients as they need it, often remotely over the phone or via Microsoft Teams.
  </li>
  <li>
   Monitor the health of our client’s solutions, by performing preventative maintenance and “health check” reports.
  </li>
  <li>
   Stay ahead of the Microsoft technology curve and provide insights into upcoming technologies or solutions which benefit them.
  </li>
  <li>
   Provide an exemplary level of client service and focus, with appropriate support responses and friendly communication.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sound interesting? Here’s the key skills set you’ll need to qualify:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Previous experience working supporting Microsoft applications.
  </li>
  <li>
   Outstanding communication skills – you will be someone who’s easy to talk to, a naturally charming individual and can translate technical issues to non-technical people.
  </li>
  <li>
   Outstanding listening skills – a key part of the role is listening to the client to *really* understand what the problem is (perhaps not the symptoms they are describing).
  </li>
  <li>
   Strong ability to work with clients to calmly, quickly and logically identify and diagnose issues.  This often needs to be done in a short time frame, so strong problem solving and technical troubleshooting skills are vital.
  </li>
  <li>
   Superior interpersonal skills especially when it comes to managing client relationships.  You have to take ownership of client issues.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ability to be resourceful and develop general knowledge base or how-to articles.
  </li>
  <li>
   Desire to be a key part of a team, have some fun, and take pride in your work and helping others.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

PhD Student: Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine Scholarship,Flinders University,Adelaide,Education & Training,Research & Fellowships,0,Full time,10/05/2022,https://www.seek.com.au//job/56922522?type=standout,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  The Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine Scholarship is an exciting new research opportunity for a PhD student within the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute at Flinders University https://www.flinders.edu.au/health-medical-research-institute. Outstanding and highly motivated candidates with a passion to improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients are invited to apply.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h2>
  PROJECT DETAILS
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are many different drugs that can be used to treat men with metastatic prostate cancer. Additionally, men with prostate cancer are also frequently receiving treatments for other health issues, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. To improve clinical care, we need personalised tools to: i) identify the right cancer treatment for a specific patient; and ii) determine whether other drugs being taken by patients will influence the efficacy of the cancer treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our group presently has access to individual-patient data (demographic, clinical, laboratory and tumour data) from thousands of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The broad aim of the project is to use sophisticated data analytic methods (e.g. machine learning) to interrogate this unique dataset and, from there, develop tools and guidelines that enable more precise and effective patient treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
  This project represents an exciting and emerging field of research that uses “big data” to improve health outcomes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   THE SUPERVISORY TEAM
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The successful candidate will be supervised by an outstanding multidisciplinary team comprising experts in clinical epidemiology, biostatistics and data analytics (Dr Ashley Hopkins, Professor Michael Sorich), prostate cancer biology (Associate Professor Luke Selth) and prostate cancer medical oncology and pharmacology (Dr Ganessan Kichenadasse). More information about the supervisors can be found here:

   PhD Project: Interactive machine learning towards human-trustworthy AI
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Make your mark in the exciting AI field of deep reinforcement learning
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in artificial intelligence (AI) and interested in the emerging field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering an exceptional opportunity to apply for an innovative project-based PhD at UniSA in partnership with the Motion Platform and Mixed Reality (MPMR) Lab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This project aims to explore DRL as a key area of AI research to address cutting-edge problems in human-trustworthy decision intelligence. As part of an emerging topic in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the challenge of the DRL training process is that humans struggle to quickly understand the complex environments that DRL machines interact with and to interpret relevant actions to achieve goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this research project, you will develop interpretable systems with human-like reasoning capabilities through interactive machine learning prototypes that enhance human-machine collaboration. Additionally, the project involves researching representation algorithms to extract key properties in DRL machines and exploring human trust in machine interpretations, which are critical to the success of human-trusted DRL in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This PhD is an exciting opportunity to be a part of a growing field at the very edge of development and prepares you for a career in an expert field of high demand.

   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group.

  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.

   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>

In addition to the skills gained through the larger research project, you will also have opportunities to develop an international network with key stakeholders involved in ePortfolios, SRL and, more broadly, learning engagement in higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  There may also be opportunities for travel and placement, such as travel to data collection sites (e.g. other universities) as well as travel to international conferences.

   PhD Project: What do South Australian firms need to enable and support high growth? Developing a ‘missing links’ public policy
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Inform public policy on business growth
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in business and innovation and are interested in public policy, the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering a project- based PhD through our
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/centre-for-enterprise-dynamics-in-global-economies/"" target=""_blank"">
   Centre for Enterprise Dynamics in Global Economies
  </a>
  (C-EDGE) in partnership with the

  </a>
  and the
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/cbg/"" target=""_blank"">
   Australian Centre for Business Growth
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government policy often takes a top-down approach to deliver initiatives and interventions that respond to a broad ‘market failure’. Alternatively, they will ‘pick winners’ and target a priority sector for growth. The aim of this project is to equip policymakers with the tools to consider a bottom-up ‘missing links’ approach to policy formation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The objective of this project-based research degree is to determine the influential effects that various policy and support programs have on established companies choosing opportunities and strategies for high growth. The project will consider a range of options that support high growth across education, financial grants, locational factors, human resource choices, digitisation, and supply chain/market diversification. The results will provide evidence-based guides for both policymakers and industry practitioners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This project is a dynamic partnership between the Department of Premier and Cabinet, UniSA’s Australian Centre for Business Growth, and C-EDGE. You will be part of a research program that aligns with and supports the South Australian Government’s prosperity and growth objectives, preparing you for a career in business growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will join a vibrant and engaging research culture within UniSA and be given ample opportunity to build your social and professional networks. You will also gain exposure to and experience with leading scholars and research methods to build your innovation expertise, and be co-located with an active cohort of success-driven higher degree research students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a valuable opportunity to be part of a collaborative group of researchers, producing articles for research and practitioner publications, and engaging with industry partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will have the opportunity to develop a research design and the necessary skills to respond to a critical policy question. Your customised research will contribute to modernising approaches for governments to facilitate enterprise growth and dynamics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon successful completion you will demonstrate significant theoretical and analytical skills, advanced knowledge in a relevant and impactful area, and have the ability to effectively communicate research results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will also gain access to career enhancing internship opportunities during your studies. This will provide you with critical industry research insights, and additional project management and data visualisation skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will be funded for one conference to conduct research and for professional development and networking.

   PhD Project - Parametric VR: Applying and Exploring Virtual Reality Systems to Better Support Parametric Design
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Inform the impact on architects and industry perceptions regarding adopting VR in Parametric Design
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project has been established at the University of South Australia (UniSA) to investigate a new and intuitive set of user interactions for Virtual Reality (VR) to support parametric design in architecture. 'Parametric VR' is a new and exciting research topic that can advance the architecture and construction sector by supporting highly innovative design processes, improved design performances, optimised design interactions, and simplified workflows. These improvements are realised through VR-enabled capabilities: design immersion, virtual prototyping, and cognitive enhancement. As more daily activities are conducted remotely, VR immersive technologies can also effectively support design collaborations. VR can improve interactions in parametric design, which have been critically underdeveloped. Parametric VR will further the developments of both technologies and deepen their impact on the global design industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supported by the Discovery Project team, UniSA Creative is seeking a qualified candidate to conduct a PhD research project to develop and test prototype(s) of Parametric VR, a novel system of VR tools to support parametric design, allowing architects to directly edit parametric design in VR across the project lifecycle. This PhD will specifically focus on design application and adoption of the technological developments including:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Determining appropriate application(s) of VR to the parametric design pipeline and at the true scale of architectural design projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Developing/adopting and mapping software tools and VR interactions against the selected parametric processes and tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Testing the effectiveness of Parametric VR prototype(s) and design scenario(s) through user studies with architects.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The project will be hosted at UniSA Creative and the
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/ive/"" target=""_blank"">
   Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments
  </a>
  (IVE), in collaboration with UniSA STEM. The successful PhD candidate will be supported by the extended research networks including end-user organisations and international collaborators as enabled by the ARC Discovery Project. The successful candidate will be working amongst a strong cohort of PhD students in IVE, who share similar passion and research interests to create high-impact outputs with strong peer support. During the project, the PhD candidate will be guided to develop research publications in journals and conference for knowledge dissemination and exchange. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to undertake a placement at the end user organisation to gain end-user/industry experiences and to further validate and disseminate the research.

  Australia is regularly affected by severe weather events. These events are growing in frequency and severity, leading to increased impacts on the economy, infrastructure, property, and wellbeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  To address this, the Bureau of Meteorology is undertaking significant steps to deliver a more customer focussed, integrated and resilient national operation. This is an exciting direction for the Bureau which will change the way we deliver services to Australian communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The future operating model for the Bureau will create new career pathways to enhance our culture, to empower our people to learn and grow. As part of this transformation, we are introducing new roles that will assist the Bureau in delivering world class weather products and services within the newly formed Community Services Group (CSG).
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  This group is comprised of Environmental Prediction Services (EPS), Decision Support Services (DSS) and National Production Services (NPS) which have been configured to enable scalable, national and resilient services. The EPS Program will establish a world class centre of scientific expertise. To achieve this, EPS has been configured into four predictive service units: Severe Weather, Marine and Antarctic, Water, and Climate, each of which play a key role in the value chain of the Bureau's capability to deliver a suite of valuable products and services to the Australian community.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The objective of the Marine and Antarctic team is to deliver unsurpassed environmental prediction services for marine, coastal and oceans hazards offshore, in coastal waters and on the Australian and the Antarctic continents, including surrounding ice areas and international waters. To deliver these objectives the team is divided into two sub teams, Ocean and Antarctic Services and Tsunami, Marine and Coastal Hazards.  Both these teams operate within a footprint across Hobart, Adelaide and Melbourne and together support and deliver a number of different services.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The Ocean and Antarctic Services team specialises in ocean dynamics, sea level, tides, ice and high latitude weather. The team is comprised of specialists who design, develop and manage the capabilities required to deliver the oceans, tides, Antarctic and ice products and services. The team monitors ocean and ice conditions and delivers ocean and tidal analysis and predictions. The team stands up operationally as required to deliver Antarctic weather and ice services, including in a customer decision support role. Our customers come from a range of BSG priority sectors, community and emergency services.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The Senior Ocean Specialist will have an excellent understanding of the science, systems and technology and processes behind our sea level and tides services. As part of the team, you will contribute to the operations and continuous improvement of these services.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  You will display a dedicated curiosity about sea level, tides and oceanography and the impacts of the evolving ocean and climate landscape. Employing personal drive and integrity, and communicating with influence, you will empower a high-performing team through promoting a positive culture of teamwork and continuous improvement. This will include a demonstrated ability to coach, develop and mentor individuals and develop their sea level and oceanography expertise and build internal and external relationships across the value chain.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  This role will report to the Ocean and Antarctic Services Team Lead. The successful candidate will be committed to supporting the Bureau and our partners outside the scope of standard working hours during significant events and peak periods. The successful candidate may be required to carry out their duties remotely for either a period or until otherwise advised.

 Fujitsu complies with government legislation in various jurisdictions which in certain circumstances may impose a requirement that certain workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 (or otherwise have a valid exemption).  Also, for client facing roles, many of our customers require our staff to be vaccinated to attend their workplaces. Based on Fujitsu’s assessment of workplace risk and the safety and wellbeing of our people and consultation with our staff, Fujitsu has introduced a Vaccination Requirements policy which requires all persons entering a Fujitsu workplace, attending a Fujitsu work-related event, or entering other premises to undertake work on Fujitsu’s behalf to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or the subject of an appropriate exemption (and to provide evidence of the same).  Consequently as a result of Fujitsu’s policy, and, where applicable , customer and legislated vaccination requirements, Fujitsu requires all new employees to be fully vaccinated or have an authorised exemption approved by Fujitsu’s Crisis management Team (CMT). Recruits will be required to provide evidence of their vaccination status as part of the recruitment process.

   PhD Project: Closing an evidence-practice gap in Parkinson’s disease: Improving the quality of life of people living with Parkinson’s disease by advancing pain care provision
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Improve the lives of those with Parkinson’s disease
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in clinical practice and interested in improving the lives of those living with Parkinson’s disease, the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering a project-based research degree in partnership with
  <a href=""https://fightingparkinsons.org.au/"" target=""_blank"">
   The Hospital Research Foundation – Fight Parkinson’s Group.
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This research project will investigate the issues around and perceptions of pain in people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Amongst this group, pain is poorly understood and managed within healthcare settings, reducing quality of life for sufferers and their carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project will investigate the barriers associated with the use of evidence-based pain assessment tools.  Once these are established, our research will aim to ensure that the findings are translated into clinical practice, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life in people living with PD and their carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will be immersed in a research-rich environment with regular training, supervision, support and feedback. You will be able to interact with other interdisciplinary health professionals, as well as industry via
  <a href=""https://fightingparkinsons.org.au/"" target=""_blank"">
   The Hospital Research Foundation – Fight Parkinson’s
  </a>
  . The opportunity to undertake an industry placement with this Foundation will provide you with a valuable career launchpad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will develop skills in qualitative and quantitative research through undertaking a literature review, extracting data from included studies, evaluating risk of bias of included studies, assessing the quality of evidence, reporting results and developing manuscripts for publication. You will also conduct focus group studies and individual interviews, and distribute and manage a survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opportunities may also arise for conference travel and presentations, and you will also be trained in writing grant applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The enhanced clinical expertise related to the management of Parkinson’s disease and interdisciplinary care, and the enhanced ability to translate research into clinical practice will give you a competitive edge in the health and care industry.

 <p>
  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  An exciting research opportunity is available for a postdoctoral researcher to support Australian Research Council (ARC)-funded research in the team of Dr Yee Lian Chew, based at the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, Bedford Park, Flinders University (Kaurna Country).
 </p>
 <p>
  This project focuses on identifying how proteostasis mechanisms contribute to neuronal ageing using protein proximity-labelling techniques in cultured cells and in
  <em>
   Caenorhabditis elegans
  </em>
  (nematode roundworm).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Postdoctoral Research Scientist will drive research activities using cultured cells and
  <em>
   C. elegans
  </em>
  models, using a combination of protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy. In this role you will be expected to work under guidance from supervisors (weekly/fortnightly) but will work autonomously on a day-to-day basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is dedicated to both promoting equity and inclusivity and acting in an equitable and inclusive way. We also celebrate and champion diversity. We are keen to support the careers of researchers who have had career disruptions or who currently or will in the future, have caring roles. We encourage women and gender diverse applicants, people with a disability, people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, and those from culturally diverse backgrounds to apply. The work involves tasks requiring manual dexterity, visual acuity adequate to perform microscopy and dispense small volume, and a willingness to work with nematodes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About You
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be an enthusiastic and motivated Postdoctoral Research Scientist with demonstrated organisational skill and the motivation to carry out autonomous research and meet deadlines. You will have well developed interpersonal skills, demonstrating cultural sensitivity and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. You will also show evidence of well-developed written and verbal communication skills, for example, publications or submissions to scientific journals/conference presentations. To be successful in this role you will also demonstrate:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A PhD (or will shortly satisfy the requirements of a PhD) in a relevant discipline such as Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and/or Neuroscience (or any relevant field).
  </li>
  <li>
   An ability to apply skills in protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy across a range of tasks in the completion of research projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with protein biochemistry (western blotting, sample preparation for mass spectrometry) is highly desirable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with tissue culture and/or
   <em>
    elegans
   </em>
   is desirable but not essential.

   The Opportunity
  </strong>
  <br/>
  The primary purpose of the role is to manage and deliver scientific outcomes relating to the South Australian Marine Scalefish Fishery, South Australian Lakes and Coorong Fishery (Finfish) and provide scientific support to other projects in the Community-Based Fisheries Sub-Program within the Fisheries Program at SARDI Aquatic Sciences. The Community-Based Fisheries Sub-Program undertakes stock assessments and carries out biological and ecological research to meet the information needs of managers charged with responsibility for managing sustainable exploitation and equitable allocation of finfish fisheries resources in South Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The role contributes to delivering high-quality scientific information and advice to facilitate the sustainable management of community-based fishery resources in South Australian waters, through successful and timely delivery of research, publishing stock assessment reports and articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The role contributes to the research assessments and projects overseen by the Community-Based Fisheries Sub-Program. The primary focus of the group is on the population dynamics and fisheries biology of key finfish species and application of the daily egg production method to estimate spawning biomass. Fishery dependent and biological data are integrated in stock assessments that determine the status of harvested populations. The primary outputs are stock assessment reports that provide the scientific basis for sustainable fisheries management. Scientific findings are published in peer-reviewed reports, and national and international journals. Research findings are also communicated directly to PIRSA fisheries managers, fishery licence holders and national and international scientists through relevant steering committees, meetings and conferences. The role is also responsible for exploring opportunities for external funding to conduct new research projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The role contributes delivering the agency’s priorities including securing production through biosecurity and efficient and sustainable use of resources.

   PhD Project - Re-imagining Public Spaces: Subjectivity and Confessional Art
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Exploring confessional creative practices and their impact on contemporary subjectivity
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in the creative industries and are interested in developing your visual art practice, the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering an exciting opportunity to apply for a project-based PhD at UniSA in partnership with
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/connect/samstag-museum/"" target=""_blank"">
   The Samstag Museum of Art
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the boundaries between private and public space become increasingly problematised in our confessional society (e.g. Instagram, the blogosphere, and Facebook), this research asks how contemporary confessional art can give voice to displaced subjectivities that challenge coercive mechanisms of public spaces to present a more complex politics of self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This practice-led research project seeks to investigate the notion and prevalence of our contemporary confessional society and its impact on, and relationship to, the visual arts. Specifically, the project examines a contemporary confessional art practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will have access to state-of-the-art research and studio facilities, including the Jeffery Smart Library, UniSA Creative research facilities, a private art studio, and collegial research community. Additionally, you will have access to a number of contemporary spaces such as the Samstag Museum, Liverpool Street Gallery, JamFactory, and Nexus Arts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will aim to frame contemporary confessional discourse as a less coercive and regulatory practice, by establishing a dialogue between technologies of the self and contemporary confessional art practice. You will apply a post-structuralist methodology to align Foucauldian philosophical notions of the self to a contemporary confessional art practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon completion, you will present a professional body of creative work along with an exegesis outlining the context for the methods and methodology employed and the insights gained during the program. Through partnering with industry and an end-user of research, you will have opportunities to network and develop skills for research excellence with career relevance. With access to funding to support attendance at local, national, and international conferences, workshops, seminars, and research-related exhibitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Where you’ll be based
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will be based at UniSA Creative, which incorporates the South Australian School of Art, and brings together the disciplines of architecture, planning, art and design, journalism, communication and media, film and television, and the creative industries to produce graduates with multidisciplinary capabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students learn by doing, crafting in specialist studios, constructing in purpose-built production facilities, always working with the latest technology. UniSA provides a platform for emerging and established creatives in its three major galleries the Samstag Museum, SASA Gallery or MOD.

  Surveillance and Response Systems Program Office (SRSPO) ensures the availability and performance of highly complex surveillance and response airborne and related systems for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

  Along with SRSPO’s Executive, the COMSO is a promoter of a positive security culture therefore you must be able to engage and proactively communicate with influence to stakeholders of all levels. The Defence environment has unique Security challenges therefore you will need to be proficient at researching and analysing complex information, the environment, and situations/incidents, to identify process inadequacies and conduct risk management accordingly.

 Fujitsu complies with government legislation in various jurisdictions which in certain circumstances may impose a requirement that certain workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 (or otherwise have a valid exemption).  Also, for client facing roles, many of our customers require our staff to be vaccinated to attend their workplaces. Based on Fujitsu’s assessment of workplace risk and the safety and wellbeing of our people and consultation with our staff, Fujitsu has introduced a Vaccination Requirements policy which requires all persons entering a Fujitsu workplace, attending a Fujitsu work-related event, or entering other premises to undertake work on Fujitsu’s behalf to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or the subject of an appropriate exemption (and to provide evidence of the same).  Consequently as a result of Fujitsu’s policy, and, where applicable , customer and legislated vaccination requirements, Fujitsu requires all new employees to be fully vaccinated or have an authorised exemption approved by Fujitsu’s Crisis management Team (CMT). Recruits will be required to provide evidence of their vaccination status as part of the recruitment process.

   PhD Project: Interactive machine learning towards human-trustworthy AI
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Make your mark in the exciting AI field of deep reinforcement learning
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in artificial intelligence (AI) and interested in the emerging field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering an exceptional opportunity to apply for an innovative project-based PhD at UniSA in partnership with the Motion Platform and Mixed Reality (MPMR) Lab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This project aims to explore DRL as a key area of AI research to address cutting-edge problems in human-trustworthy decision intelligence. As part of an emerging topic in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the challenge of the DRL training process is that humans struggle to quickly understand the complex environments that DRL machines interact with and to interpret relevant actions to achieve goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this research project, you will develop interpretable systems with human-like reasoning capabilities through interactive machine learning prototypes that enhance human-machine collaboration. Additionally, the project involves researching representation algorithms to extract key properties in DRL machines and exploring human trust in machine interpretations, which are critical to the success of human-trusted DRL in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This PhD is an exciting opportunity to be a part of a growing field at the very edge of development and prepares you for a career in an expert field of high demand.

  <strong>
   Your Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two ongoing positions as a STEM Analyst on the Impacts of Advanced Technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will develop a deep understanding of a range of technologies, and work with experts to foresee how these technologies will develop into the future. You will then creatively assess how these developments might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests, with a focus on Defence and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others). You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a sound understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
  <br/>

Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, academia or industry.

Advance Technology Foresight Analyst EL 1 (S&T Level 5),Department of Defence,Adelaide,Government & Defence,Government - Federal,"$106,074 - $119,651 (plus super)",Full time,13/05/2022,https://www.seek.com.au//job/56972635?type=standout,"<div class=""yvsb870 _1v38w810"">
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is offering two permanent positions as an Advanced Technology Foresight Analyst.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will develop a sound understanding of a broad range of technologies, including current technologies and those that may be developed in the future. You will work with planners and operations analysts to foresee how these technologies might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  One position, located in Canberra, will focus on national security and the way it may operate in the future, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new concepts of operations. The other position, located in Melbourne will focus on Defence capabilities, including foreseeing disruptions or entirely new capabilities. Although the positions are based in Canberra and Melbourne, we are open to the idea of having our candidate work from our in Edinburgh, SA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&amp;T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others).
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a deep understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About our Team
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology analyst team is a part of the Defence Impacts of Emerging Technology (DIET) Group, within Strategy and Joint Force (SJF) Major Science and Technology Capability (MSTC), which is itself within the Joint and Operations Analysis Division of the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).
 </p>
 <p>
  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&amp;T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&amp;C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is passionate, professional, welcoming and inclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our Ideal Candidate
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We are seeking an Australian citizen who is naturally curious and motivated to develop broad expertise across diverse emerging technologies. Candidates from all S&amp;T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, or have been responsible for leading and delivering projects in academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.
 </p>
 <p>
  S&amp;T 5 level jobs are typically suitable for mid-career professionals rather than entry level jobs for graduates. You will have no formal responsibilities for supervising staff, but you will be expected to show leadership and take responsibility for driving outcomes and enhancing the capabilities of our team.
 </p>
 <p>
  A PhD or equivalent qualifications/experience is required.

   You'll be joining a business with massive investment that's growing. Fast. That means real opportunity to climb into more senior, challenging positions as the company develops
  </li>
  <li>
   A role that *actually* supports home working. You'll be working as part of a fully distributed team. There's an office in Sydney if you want to use it. It's not mandatory though.
  </li>
 </ul>

   PhD Project - Parametric VR: Applying and Exploring Virtual Reality Systems to Better Support Parametric Design
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Inform the impact on architects and industry perceptions regarding adopting VR in Parametric Design
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project has been established at the University of South Australia (UniSA) to investigate a new and intuitive set of user interactions for Virtual Reality (VR) to support parametric design in architecture. 'Parametric VR' is a new and exciting research topic that can advance the architecture and construction sector by supporting highly innovative design processes, improved design performances, optimised design interactions, and simplified workflows. These improvements are realised through VR-enabled capabilities: design immersion, virtual prototyping, and cognitive enhancement. As more daily activities are conducted remotely, VR immersive technologies can also effectively support design collaborations. VR can improve interactions in parametric design, which have been critically underdeveloped. Parametric VR will further the developments of both technologies and deepen their impact on the global design industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supported by the Discovery Project team, UniSA Creative is seeking a qualified candidate to conduct a PhD research project to develop and test prototype(s) of Parametric VR, a novel system of VR tools to support parametric design, allowing architects to directly edit parametric design in VR across the project lifecycle. This PhD will specifically focus on design application and adoption of the technological developments including:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Determining appropriate application(s) of VR to the parametric design pipeline and at the true scale of architectural design projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Developing/adopting and mapping software tools and VR interactions against the selected parametric processes and tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Testing the effectiveness of Parametric VR prototype(s) and design scenario(s) through user studies with architects.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The project will be hosted at UniSA Creative and the
  <a href=""https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/ive/"" target=""_blank"">
   Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments
  </a>
  (IVE), in collaboration with UniSA STEM. The successful PhD candidate will be supported by the extended research networks including end-user organisations and international collaborators as enabled by the ARC Discovery Project.

 <p>
  Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  An exciting research opportunity is available for a postdoctoral researcher to support Australian Research Council (ARC)-funded research in the team of Dr Yee Lian Chew, based at the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, Bedford Park, Flinders University (Kaurna Country).
 </p>
 <p>
  This project focuses on identifying how proteostasis mechanisms contribute to neuronal ageing using protein proximity-labelling techniques in cultured cells and in
  <em>
   Caenorhabditis elegans
  </em>
  (nematode roundworm).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Postdoctoral Research Scientist will drive research activities using cultured cells and
  <em>
   C. elegans
  </em>
  models, using a combination of protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy. In this role you will be expected to work under guidance from supervisors (weekly/fortnightly) but will work autonomously on a day-to-day basis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our team is dedicated to both promoting equity and inclusivity and acting in an equitable and inclusive way. We also celebrate and champion diversity. We are keen to support the careers of researchers who have had career disruptions or who currently or will in the future, have caring roles. We encourage women and gender diverse applicants, people with a disability, people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, and those from culturally diverse backgrounds to apply. The work involves tasks requiring manual dexterity, visual acuity adequate to perform microscopy and dispense small volume, and a willingness to work with nematodes.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About You
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be an enthusiastic and motivated Postdoctoral Research Scientist with demonstrated organisational skill and the motivation to carry out autonomous research and meet deadlines. You will have well developed interpersonal skills, demonstrating cultural sensitivity and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. You will also show evidence of well-developed written and verbal communication skills, for example, publications or submissions to scientific journals/conference presentations. To be successful in this role you will also demonstrate:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A PhD (or will shortly satisfy the requirements of a PhD) in a relevant discipline such as Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and/or Neuroscience (or any relevant field).
  </li>
  <li>
   An ability to apply skills in protein biochemistry, genetics and microscopy across a range of tasks in the completion of research projects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with protein biochemistry (western blotting, sample preparation for mass spectrometry) is highly desirable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Experience with tissue culture and/or
   <em>
    elegans
   </em>
   is desirable but not essential.
  </li>

  CoreLogic is the leading provider of property data and analytics in Australia and New Zealand. We’re fiercely independent, and we’re considered the best in the business. Every day, our data scientists and researchers collect data from over 4.5 billion points across the CoreLogic universe. We then rinse and finesse this data to transform it into powerful property market insights that drive the best property decisions.

  <strong>
   Who are we?
  </strong>
  <br/>
  CoreLogic is the leading provider of property data and analytics in Australia and New Zealand. We’re fiercely independent, and we’re considered the best in the business. Every day, our data scientists and researchers collect data from over 4.5 billion points across the CoreLogic universe. We then rinse and finesse this data to transform it into powerful property market insights that drive the best property decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Our purpose
  </strong>
  <br/>
  At CoreLogic, we help people build better lives by providing rich property insights that inform the very best property decisions. We know that behind all the numbers, algorithms, and sophisticated data technology there are people, families, and communities. There are hopes, dreams, ambitions, journeys, expectations, fears, crossed fingers and vulnerability. It’s those things that matter. And it’s those things that we want to connect with, enable and tackle.

  <strong>
   Emma Harrison | Business Group Leader – Contamination and Environmental Management | Sydney, NSW
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ""As a mother of four, I felt resigned to the fact that after ten years out of the scientific industry, the only way back in was through full-time study. Then I found GHD's Career Relaunch Program in 2018, which offered me a genuine opportunity to redevelop my career while still being able to support my four children as a single parent. I was offered an ongoing role as Senior Environmental Geologist after the program ended, and now three years later, I have recently moved into the Business Group Leader for Contamination and Environmental Management role, looking after 40 wonderful, talented professionals in this group.""
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marguerite Cooper | Environmental Scientist | Sydney, NSW
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I reached a point after the birth of my second child, where I felt I was unable to perform to the best of my ability in either role as a scientist or a mum. I decided to take some time off to focus on my family, and two years later I was ready to return to work. I had been looking for work for around 18 months before I came across GHD’s Career Relaunch Program. GHD’s flexible working policy allowed me to re-join the workforce while still managing school and childcare requirements. It was wonderful to see that colleagues understood what the Career Relaunch Program was all about and were happy to provide me with a little extra time and flexibility to find my feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sam Marsh | Environmental Scientist | Hobart, TAS
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “After moving from sunny Cairns to Hobart, I spent some time travelling around Australia, trying new jobs including working as a farm attendant on a Tassal fish farm in Tasmania. When I was ready to get back into my professional field, I was worried about learning how to work in a corporate environment once again. For me GHD's Career Relaunch Program meant I was able to develop new skills in the science industry and personally develop lifelong skills working with others and communicating on a professional level.”

  <strong>
   Emma Harrison | Business Group Leader – Contamination and Environmental Management | Sydney, NSW
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ""As a mother of four, I felt resigned to the fact that after ten years out of the scientific industry, the only way back in was through full-time study. Then I found GHD's Career Relaunch Program in 2018, which offered me a genuine opportunity to redevelop my career while still being able to support my four children as a single parent. I was offered an ongoing role as Senior Environmental Geologist after the program ended, and now three years later, I have recently moved into the Business Group Leader for Contamination and Environmental Management role, looking after 40 wonderful, talented professionals in this group.""
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marguerite Cooper | Environmental Scientist | Sydney, NSW
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I reached a point after the birth of my second child, where I felt I was unable to perform to the best of my ability in either role as a scientist or a mum. I decided to take some time off to focus on my family, and two years later I was ready to return to work. I had been looking for work for around 18 months before I came across GHD’s Career Relaunch Program. GHD’s flexible working policy allowed me to re-join the workforce while still managing school and childcare requirements. It was wonderful to see that colleagues understood what the Career Relaunch Program was all about and were happy to provide me with a little extra time and flexibility to find my feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sam Marsh | Environmental Scientist | Hobart, TAS
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “After moving from sunny Cairns to Hobart, I spent some time travelling around Australia, trying new jobs including working as a farm attendant on a Tassal fish farm in Tasmania. When I was ready to get back into my professional field, I was worried about learning how to work in a corporate environment once again. For me GHD's Career Relaunch Program meant I was able to develop new skills in the science industry and personally develop lifelong skills working with others and communicating on a professional level.”

   About Us
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the great challenges in the world right now is the need to move to greener energy and technology solutions. To do that the world needs more copper, steel and rare earth metals than ever before.

  At MaxMine we work to improve mining efficiency - we focus on what we can do

   PhD Project: ePortfolios and self-regulated learning in higher education
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Positively impact higher education policy and practice on an international scale.
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Are you seeking to advance your career in higher education through defining education policy and practice nationally and internationally? The University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering a unique opportunity to apply for an innovative, project-based PhD aimed at accomplishing this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to current and future priorities, higher education institutions are increasingly positioning ePortfolios to develop and evidence competencies and skills that are highly correspondent to self-regulated learning (SRL). Research into ePortfolios and their relationships to SRL, however demonstrate limitations in methodology and potential impact. Therefore, there is a timely need to advance research into relationships between ePortfolios and SRL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this collaborative research project involving four universities – one American and three Australian – you will  be expected to use qualitative and quantitative approaches to investigate the relationship between ePortfolios and SRL in the higher education context. Our intention is to impact research, policy and practice within both Australia and the United States.

In addition to the skills gained through the larger research project, you will also have opportunities to develop an international network with key stakeholders involved in ePortfolios, SRL and, more broadly, learning engagement in higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Completion of this project will provide you with highly desirable skills in a growing area, advancing your employability within and beyond the higher education sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will undertake activities standard to a large-scale project of this nature. These include reviews of research, development of methodology, data collection, data cleaning and data set development, analysis and write up of results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There may also be opportunities for travel and placement, such as travel to data collection sites (e.g. other universities) as well as travel to international conferences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intended results will include a completed thesis by the successful candidate, publication opportunities, and development of an international collaboration network of both universities and strategic partners.

  <strong>
   PhD Project - Considering realistic shapes for granular materials in civil engineering
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Advance knowledge in granular materials
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in civil engineering and interested in granular materials, the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering a unique project-based PhD in partnership with
  <a href=""https://www.cmwgeosciences.com/"" target=""_blank"">
   CMW Geosciences.
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil infrastructures are built on granular materials. The loss of granular materials’ shear strength can lead to catastrophic failures of civil infrastructures and result in significant casualties, so it is important to understanding how and why this occurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The particle shape is said to play an important role in the shear strength of granular materials. Most studies have considered a very idealised particle shape. This research project will seek to understand the current challenges around digitising particle shape and propose a modified discrete element model which can handle complex particle shapes within a reasonable computational time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Through this research, you will provide insight into the interactions between discrete particles and develop a quantitative framework to assess granular material strength. The CT scan technique will be used to visualise the microstructure of granular material and this information will be transferred to the discrete element model for further analysis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Join a dynamic team within geotechnical research, comprised of world-class researchers and a strong cohort of PhD students. We are currently collaborating with more than 35 local, national and international organisations so you will have ample opportunity to grow your professional and industry network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will be trained to use numerical programs for discrete element modelling and digital image processing. You will also perform triaxial and simple shear tests to validate the results from the numerical analyses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expertise you gain in both numerical programming and laboratory experiment will give you a competitive edge as there is a deficit of researchers within this area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will be encouraged and supported to attend a conference to present your research.

   PhD Project: Closing an evidence-practice gap in Parkinson’s disease: Improving the quality of life of people living with Parkinson’s disease by advancing pain care provision
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Improve the lives of those with Parkinson’s disease
  </em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are seeking to advance your career in clinical practice and interested in improving the lives of those living with Parkinson’s disease, the University of South Australia – Australia’s University of Enterprise – is offering a project-based research degree in partnership with
  <a href=""https://fightingparkinsons.org.au/"" target=""_blank"">
   The Hospital Research Foundation – Fight Parkinson’s Group.
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This research project will investigate the issues around and perceptions of pain in people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Amongst this group, pain is poorly understood and managed within healthcare settings, reducing quality of life for sufferers and their carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project will investigate the barriers associated with the use of evidence-based pain assessment tools.  Once these are established, our research will aim to ensure that the findings are translated into clinical practice, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life in people living with PD and their carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will be immersed in a research-rich environment with regular training, supervision, support and feedback. You will be able to interact with other interdisciplinary health professionals, as well as industry via

   The Hospital Research Foundation – Fight Parkinson’s
  </a>
  . The opportunity to undertake an industry placement with this Foundation will provide you with a valuable career launchpad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What you’ll do
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this project-based research degree, you will develop skills in qualitative and quantitative research through undertaking a literature review, extracting data from included studies, evaluating risk of bias of included studies, assessing the quality of evidence, reporting results and developing manuscripts for publication. You will also conduct focus group studies and individual interviews, and distribute and manage a survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opportunities may also arise for conference travel and presentations, and you will also be trained in writing grant applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The enhanced clinical expertise related to the management of Parkinson’s disease and interdisciplinary care, and the enhanced ability to translate research into clinical practice will give you a competitive edge in the health and care industry.

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   About the Role
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Applications are invited for two 3-year postdoctoral research positions in hydrogeology, within the College of Science and Engineering at Flinders University. Flinders is the headquarters of the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, established in 2009 through an initiative of the ARC and the National Water Commission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Successful applicants will join the team of Prof. Adrian Werner to advance groundwater research goals within the Australian Research Council project ""Sustaining intensive agriculture through droughts and floods""; a collaboration between Flinders University, Monash University, Charles Darwin University, and Lower Burdekin Water (LBW).
 </p>
 <p>
  Researchers will investigate recharge, surface water-groundwater interactions, freshwater-saltwater dynamics and water management practices within a coastal aquifer in north Queensland (the Lower Burdekin Delta; LBD), using various hydrogeological techniques and leading to world-class publications. For example, saltwater dynamics will be explored using numerical groundwater models and laboratory sand-tank experiments, supported by extensive field data from the field site, where agricultural water demand draws extensively on the coastal aquifers of the region. The long-term behaviour of the groundwater systems of the LBD in response to natural and human-induced variations in climate, land use, river regulation and groundwater pumping will be explored.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
