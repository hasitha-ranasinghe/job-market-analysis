      "  You will develop a deep understanding of a range of technologies, and work with experts to foresee how these technologies will develop into the future. You will then creatively assess how these developments might strengthen or weaken Australia’s national interests, with a focus on Defence and national security.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  The role involves desk-based technical research and analysis as part of a large team responsible for providing emerging technology and foresight advice to Defence and other government departments. You will be responsible for a technical area that corresponds to your current S&T skills, and will broaden your expertise into a range of fields relevant to Defence (for example AI, cyber, biotechnology, quantum and many others). You will be trained in role-specific analytic skills, including data analytics and foresight techniques. You will develop a sound understanding of the structure and decision-making processes of the Defence Department, to ensure your advice is tailored to have an impact. You will develop into a communications expert, able to concisely explain technical issues to busy, non-technical stakeholders. Outputs will include written reports, verbal briefings, multi-media and infographics. The role requires building networks across our own team of experts, as well as broader DSTG, Defence and intelligence.\n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  This team is organised under DSTG’s Strategic Futures Project, and works closely with the Critical Technology Foresight (CTF) Group. You will be joining a project team of approximately 25 staff, including technology analysts (like this position), experts in tools and methods (such as AI experts who write programs to assist the analysts) and social scientists (who evaluate the impact of technology on society).\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  The Strategic Futures Project is a centre of gravity within government for emerging technology and foresight advice. Our advice feeds into decision-making, such as for senior Defence committees, the Department’s S&T portfolio planning and capability planning for the ADF. We play a key role in whole-of-government decision-making via our strong linkages to the Critical Technology Policy Coordination Office in PM&C. We partner with DSTG’s 2000 experts, across Defence, policy and intelligence agencies, and with international experts.\n",

Candidates from all S&T disciplines will be considered, but we especially seek experts in the physical sciences, engineering or systems analysis. We seek science-communicators who are passionate about making an impact for the nation. Ideally you will have experience in the APS, academia or industry. A pre-existing interest in Defence is not required, but you must be open to developing this.\n",
